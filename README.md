# PACMAN (Patman)

This project started with a basic Pacman clone.
This then evolved into the following projects:
* Patman.py - original game
* MULTI - A multiplayer, client-server game
* PATMAN_CNN - Game playing AI - using Tensorflow, I trained a machine learning model to play the game using the pixel values alone
* SEARCH - An experimental ghost searching algorithm - testing with BFS, DFS and A*
